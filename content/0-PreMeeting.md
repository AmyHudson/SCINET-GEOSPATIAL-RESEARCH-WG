## Tutorials

The tutorials presented on the workshop span the range of beginner (new to SCINet) to more advanced (Big Data and Machine Learning). If you have questions about the material, please do not hesitate to contact the organizing committee.

## Bring Your Own Data

Do you have a computation problem/hurdle that is slowing or preventing progress in your research? This may be an excellent opportunity to see how to solve it on SCINet. The goal of this session is to show-case a few real-world examples with SCINet.

We are asking participants to submit these challenges to the organizing committee, and we will select a few to present solutions to during the workshop. Note that these should be straight-forward problems that can be easily understood. If selected, we will ask participants to upload data to SCINet (we/VRSC can help with that process) as well as give a short presentation (~5 minutes) on the challenge you faced with the data. Examples of computational bottlenecks are:

  1. Visualize, aggregate, and/or characterize 50 million GPS fixes from livestock.
  2. Calculate NDVI from XXX GBs of drone/satellite data (already processed to reflectance) and make time-series plots at pastures/fields.
  3. I want to run XXX scenarios of my model (varying the forcing/input parameters). The model is compatible with Linux.

Please submit an application to User.Name@usda.gov. In your email, please include ~3-5 sentences describing the computational bottleneck, ideal outcomes, and any other pertinent information.

## Guide on Software

The software discussed and shown in the workshop is largely open source, can run on an HPC or cloud environmnet, and can be installed with software management systems that support reproducibility (such as conda, singularity, and docker).
